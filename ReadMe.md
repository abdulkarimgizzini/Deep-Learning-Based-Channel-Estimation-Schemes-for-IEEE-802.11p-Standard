This project demonstartes:
	+ The IEEE 802.11p stanadrd physical layer Tx-Rx implementation with several conventional channel estimators.
	+ The full implementation of the STA-DNNs and TRFI-DNN channel estimators proposed in [1] and [2] respectively.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note-: Please note that the project's files are divided into Matlab_Codes and Python_Codes. 
------ The Matlab_Codes folder includes all the required functions (Communication simulation part).
------ The Python_Codes folder includes the deep neural network implementation (training and testing phases). 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The project's folder is structured as follows:
	+ Matlab_Codes/Main.m: The main simulation file, where the simulation parameters (Channel model, OFDM parameters, Modulation scheme, etc...) are defined. 
	+ Matlab_Codes/Channel_functions.m: Includes the pre-defined vehicular channel models[3] for different mobility conditions.
	+ Conventional channel estimators:
		1) Matlab_Codes/Initial_Channel_Estimation.m: Includes the implementation of the data-pilot aided (DPA) channel estimation. Please note that DPA 
                is the initial estimation step in the following conventional channel estimators.
		2) Matlab_Codes/STA.m: Includes the implementation of the spectral temporal averaging (STA) channel estimator [4].
		3) Matlab_Codes/CDP.m: Includes the implementation of the constructed data pilots (CDP) channel estimator [5].
		4) Matlab_Codes/TRFI.m: Includes the implementation of the time-domain reliability test frequency-domain interpolation (TRFI) channel estimator [6].
		5) Matlab_Codes/MMSE_Virtual_Pilots.m: Includes the implementation of the minimum mean square error using virtual pilots (MMSE-VP) channel estimator [7].
	+ After running the Matlab_Codes/Main.m file and save the required estimated channel structure (ex: STA_Structure), besides the transmitted bits and the received frames. 
	The next step is to divide the saved STA_Structure into training and testing datasets using the Matlab_Codes/DNN_Datasets_Generation.m file. 
	To do this, the following steps are required:
		+ Generate the training and testing frames indices: Forexample, in the project we consider (1000 Channel realiztions with nSymbols = 100 per frame),
		then the saved STA_Structure will be of size 52x100x1000. Therefore we selected 800 and 200 random indices from (1000 indices) to be the training and testing OFDM frames
		indices respectively. (Since 80% of data is for training and 20% of data is for testing). 
		+ In this project the training and testing indices are predefined in the DNN_TestingPacketsIndices file.
		
	+ Now the generated datasets will be used in the DNN processing part, where we have:
		+ Python_Codes/DNN_Training.py: here the DNN training is performed employing the training datasets using the following terminal command:
	         python DNN_Training.py Channel_Model Modulation_Scheme Channel_Estimator Training_SNR DNN_Input Hidden_Layer1 Hidden_Layer2 Hidden_Layer3 DNN_Output Epochs Batch_size 
                 ex: >>python DNN_Training.py VTV_UC QPSK STA 7 104 15 10 15 104 500 128
		  
		+ Python_Codes/DNN_Training.py: The testing datasets are tested using the trained DNN model, and the testing results are saved in .mat files, in order to be processed later.
		The DNN testing can be executed using the following terminal command:
		python DNN_Testing.py Channel_Model Modulation_Scheme Channel_Estimator Hidden_Layer1 Hidden_Layer2 Hidden_Layer3 
                 ex: >>python DNN_Testing.py VTV_UC QPSK STA 15 10 15
		

	+ The final step is processing the testing datasets and caculate the BER and NMSE results of the STA-DNN estimator using the Matlab_Codes/DNN_Results_Processing.m
